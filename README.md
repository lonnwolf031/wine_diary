# wine_diary

A Flutter multiplatform project.

## Development notes

The intended purpose of this app is for users to keep a diary of the wines they tried, including photos, description, rating and more.

The data will be stored in a local SQlite database.
The app is intended to be built for both iOS and Android, hence the choice for Flutter.
